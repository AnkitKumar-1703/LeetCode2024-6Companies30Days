Problem Statement:

Place cameras in a binary tree so that every node is monitored.
Each camera at a node monitors its parent, itself, and immediate children.
Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes.


Examples:
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
